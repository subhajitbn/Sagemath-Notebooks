# Sagemath-Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of SageMath notebooks used to validate key steps in large-scale calculation involving partition generating functions and their analogues. These computations arise from combinatorial and generating function-related research in partition theory.

## About

The codebase supports the verification of both final results and intermediate stages within a complex chain of reasoning in partition theory, particularly related to generating functions. The scripts encapsulate various aspects of these calculations.

**Please note:** This collection of sagemath notebooks is largely undocumented, reflecting their origin as internal research tools developed primarily for personal validation rather than public distribution. I apologize for the limited documentation and understand this may make exploration challenging. A provided [tutorial notebook](The%205-core%20partitions.ipynb) is intended as a more accessible starting point and the best entry for understanding the workflow and methodology.


## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) installed on your system (recommended version: *specify version if preferred*)  
   - A Jupyter notebook environment compatible with SageMath.

2. **Running the tutorial notebook**  
   The easiest way to get started is to open and run [`The 5-core partitions.ipynb`](The%205-core%20partitions.ipynb) with SageMath kernel, which walks through example calculations and explains the workflow. This notebook provides context and commentary that helps make sense of the rest of the scripts.

3. **Exploring the other scripts**  
   The rest of the code files can be executed within SageMath to reproduce checks and intermediate steps. Due to limited documentation, familiarity with the theory of partitions and generating functions is assumed.
